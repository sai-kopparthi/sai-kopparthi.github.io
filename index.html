<h4 id="about-me"><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
<p>
Highly motivated and enthusiastic learner for new technologies and applying them. I have always tried to stretch myself beyond limits like through some projects giving me a license to explore and learn new and upcoming technologies. In my free time, I also try to explore open source community with their recent concepts and read about the latest developments in domains like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Deep Learning, etc.

Programming is my passion, as thousands of lines of code makes more sense to me than the text of a novel, be it Python, C, C++, Javascript, or Java. My current interests have been around Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Blockchain, or even something which goes in harmony with all of them which is Software Development.
